# Working with CSV Data and the Pandas library

### Day 25, I learned how to read CSV data with the Pandas library. I was given a list of squirrels in the park and had to return only the quantities of Cinnamon, Black, and Grey squirrels. At the end of the day, I developed a guessing game of the U.S. states, where the states' data were stored in a CSV file. Additionally, I used Turtle to create the interface.
