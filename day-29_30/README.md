# Password Keeper with Tkinter and GUI

### Day 29, on this day, I built a password keeper project. This is an app where you can save your emails and passwords for specific websites and save them in a text file.
### Day 30, this day was dedicated to improving the Password Keeper project. I focused on implementing exception handling and validating user data.
