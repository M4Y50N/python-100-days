# Turtle Crossing Game

### It was a capstone project and a copy of the Chicken Crossing Game. This game allows you to play as a turtle and cross a path filled with busy cars. Each time you complete a stage, the traffic becomes even busier. 
### This game was a challenging one, as I spent a lot of time figuring out how to generate random cars and track them on the screen. Detecting side collisions with cars isn't yet done with precision
