# Snake Game with what I learned about Turtle  

### Day 20 and 21, I developed a Snake game. The project was divided into two parts. On day 20, I focused on building the core mechanics of the game, I worked with classes and set up the snake's stage.
### On day 21, I finished the game by working on the remaining game logic, including collision detection and score tracking.

### Used Libraries: Turtle and Random
